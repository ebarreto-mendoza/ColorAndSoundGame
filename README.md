## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
None 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was the logic of the game. Creating the logic was not that challenging,
however when I started running the game, an issue appeared where the player would lose if they did not choose the newly added sequence n numbers of time.
I was able to quickly find the solution to this issue by running the game multiple times and look at the logic in the code.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I want to know how we can add more advanced javascript in the backend and connect that with the front end of websites.
I have the same cuiousity towards the front end, as what more can we make that will look nice and be interactive with users.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
-Add random patterns
-Add the ability to increase the length of the pattern
-Add Shapes or numbers inside the color buttons so that the game becomes more user friendly and allows for shape recognition as well.
